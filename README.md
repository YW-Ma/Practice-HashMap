# Practice-HashMap
 Building a HashMap using Array
 
 There are five steps, and I store the test cases and codes for each step in different branch.
 
- [0-hashcode-and-bucket-index](https://github.com/YW-Ma/Practice-HashMap/tree/0-hashcode-and-bucket-index) Calculating hashcode and finding the bucket index based on it.
- [1-put](https://github.com/YW-Ma/Practice-HashMap/tree/1-put) Building a basic put function to store a <key, value> pair into the bucket. Focusing on collision problem.
- [2-get](https://github.com/YW-Ma/Practice-HashMap/tree/2-get) Building a get function to find value based on a given key.
- [3-put-and-rehash](https://github.com/YW-Ma/Practice-HashMap/tree/3-put-and-rehash) Updating the put function. Focusing on load factor.
- [4-delete](https://github.com/YW-Ma/Practice-HashMap/tree/4-delete) Building a delete function to delete a <key, value> pair from the bucket.

The test cases and several notes come from Udacity-Data Structures and Algorithms
