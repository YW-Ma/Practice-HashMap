# Practice-HashMap
 Building a HashMap using Array
 
 There are five steps, and I store the test cases and codes for each step in different branch.
 
- [0-hashcode-and-bucket-index](https://github.com/YW-Ma/Practice-HashMap/tree/0-hashcode-and-bucket-index)
- [1-put](https://github.com/YW-Ma/Practice-HashMap/tree/1-put)
- [2-get](https://github.com/YW-Ma/Practice-HashMap/tree/2-get)
- [3-put-and-rehash](https://github.com/YW-Ma/Practice-HashMap/tree/3-put-and-rehash)
- [4-delete](https://github.com/YW-Ma/Practice-HashMap/tree/4-delete)

The test cases and several notes come from Udacity-Data Structures and Algorithms
